# Hand-gesture-recognition
Project to recognize hand gesture using state of the art neural networks.


Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote



In this project, you are going to build a 3D Conv model that will be able to predict the 5 gestures correctly.




The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up: Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
Stop: Pause the movie
